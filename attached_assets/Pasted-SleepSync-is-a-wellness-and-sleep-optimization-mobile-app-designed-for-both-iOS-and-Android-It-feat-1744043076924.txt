SleepSync is a wellness and sleep optimization mobile app designed for both iOS and Android. It features a dark mode interface with soft glowing neon accents, a smooth rounded UI, and a calming minimalistic aesthetic. The overall visual design leans into a modern sans-serif font to maintain a clean, serene feel throughout the experience.

The main navigation is located at the bottom as a tab bar that is visible on all pages. It includes five key sections: Home, Calendar, Explore, Music, and Account. Each tab includes both an icon and a label, with the active tab clearly highlighted to guide the user.

The Home page presents users with a clear daily overview. At the top, it displays “TODAY” centered, with “YESTERDAY” on the left and a calendar icon on the right that links directly to the Calendar page. A circular countdown widget appears beneath, showing the current status of an “Active coffee window.” This section is expandable and designed to hold more widgets in the future. Following that, the Sleep section contains a circular chart showing the sleep score and total time, alongside a bedtime suggestion like “Suggested bedtime: 11:45 PM.” The Recovery section includes a horizontal bar graph featuring body temperature, darkness exposure, and caffeine intake. Stress is presented with a simple bar indicator and a brief insight such as “Try winding down earlier tonight.” The Social Jetlag section displays a trend card tracking deviations from ideal sleep patterns.

The Calendar page allows users to view their sleep trends over time. It starts with the month and year at the top, accompanied by a back arrow to return to the Home page. A monthly calendar view appears below, with selectable dates. Users can review trends like Time in Bed and Sleep Regularity. There are filters available for different time spans including 7 Days, 30 Days, or a Custom Range.

Explore is a place for users to find new sensors that personalize their sleep and productivity insights. The header reads “Sensors Store” with a search icon and a back arrow. The main content is a scrollable list of sensor cards, each representing a different feature. These include titles like “Circadian Rhythm” or “Caffeine Windows,” a category such as Productivity or Performance, and a short description about its benefits. Cards display labels like Free, Active, or Installed, and have buttons labeled “Get,” “Out,” or “Active.” The cards use color-coded gradients, rounded corners, and a modern glowing aesthetic to differentiate each feature.

The Music section provides audio tools to help users relax and fall asleep. At the top are filter tabs for All, Meditation, Stress, and Sleep. Below is a scrollable list of music and video content, each with a thumbnail image, title, subtitle, duration, and a play icon overlay. For instance, one entry reads “Why You Should Sleep 16 Hours a Day” by “Radio Minerva,” with a duration of 11 minutes. When users click on a track, it opens a fullscreen player with the cover image, title, source, and playback controls including play/pause, 15-second rewind and forward buttons, a progress bar, timestamps, and volume control. The interface transitions smoothly between list view and fullscreen, inspired by Apple Podcasts.
